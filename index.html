She was delivered at her family's home located at <b>406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee</b>. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from <em>Shelby, Mississippi</em>. Her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships in addition to the four children they had together. <p>When Aretha was two, the family relocated to <b>Buffalo, New York</b>. By the time Aretha turned five, C. L. Franklin had permanently relocated the family to <b>Detroit</b>, where he took over the pastorship of the <em>New Bethel Baptist Church</em>.The Franklins had a troubled marriage due to Mr. Franklin's infidelities, and they separated in <b>1948</b>.</p>
