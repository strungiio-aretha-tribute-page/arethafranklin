She was delivered at her family's home located at <b>406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee</b>. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from <em>Shelby, Mississippi</em>. Her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships in addition to the four children they had together. <p>When Aretha was two, the family relocated to <b>Buffalo, New York</b>. By the time Aretha turned five, C. L. Franklin had permanently relocated the family to <b>Detroit</b>, where he took over the pastorship of the <em>New Bethel Baptist Church</em>.The Franklins had a troubled marriage due to Mr. Franklin's infidelities, and they separated in <b>1948</b>.</p>
      <p>At that time, Barbara Franklin returned to Buffalo with Aretha's half brother, Vaughn.After the separation, Aretha recalled seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, and Barbara Franklin frequently visited her children in Detroit.Aretha's mother died of a heart attack on <em>March 7, 1952</em>, before Aretha's tenth birthday.Several women, including Aretha's grandmother, Rachel, and Mahalia Jackson took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home.</p>
